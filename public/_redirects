# Netlify redirects for React SPA
# Netlify serves existing files BEFORE processing redirects
# Static files are served automatically and won't match the redirect rule below

# Redirect all routes to index.html for client-side routing (SPA)
# This ensures routes like /candidate/exam/:token work correctly
# Note: Static assets (JS, CSS, images in /static/) are served first
# and will not be affected by this redirect rule
/*    /index.html   200
