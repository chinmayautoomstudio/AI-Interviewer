# Netlify redirects for React SPA
# Netlify serves existing files BEFORE processing redirects
# So static files in /static/ will be served automatically
# This redirect only applies to routes that don't match actual files

# Redirect all routes to index.html for client-side routing
/*    /index.html   200
