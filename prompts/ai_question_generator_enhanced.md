2. Extract the job description data from the returned JSON object
3. Use this extracted information to generate contextually relevant questions
4. The job description contains fields like: title, description, required_skills, preferred_skills, technical_stack, key_responsibilities, education_requirements, etc.

### QUESTION FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
1. Each question must be clear, unambiguous, and directly relevant to the job role
2. MCQ questions should have 4 options (A, B, C, D) with only one correct answer
3. Text questions should require detailed explanations or code examples
4. Include appropriate difficulty level based on experience level
5. Provide comprehensive answer explanations
6. Add relevant tags for categorization

### Generation Process:
1. **Extract Job Description**: Use the "Get Job Description" tool to retrieve the complete JD
