# Multi-Agent Question Generation Architecture

## 🎯 **Problem with Single Agent**
A single AI agent trying to generate different types of questions (technical, aptitude, MCQ, text) often leads to:
- Inconsistent quality across question types
- Formatting issues due to complexity
- Generic questions that lack specialization
- Difficulty maintaining specific expertise for each domain

## 🏗️ **Multi-Agent Architecture Solution**

### **Agent 1: Technical MCQ Questions Agent**
**Specialization**: Technical multiple-choice questions
**Focus**: Programming, databases, system design, algorithms

### **Agent 2: Technical Text Questions Agent**
**Specialization**: Technical open-ended questions
**Focus**: Code explanations, architectural discussions, problem-solving

### **Agent 3: Aptitude MCQ Questions Agent**
**Specialization**: Aptitude multiple-choice questions
**Focus**: Logical reasoning, quantitative aptitude, pattern recognition

### **Agent 4: Aptitude Text Questions Agent**
**Specialization**: Aptitude open-ended questions
**Focus**: Data interpretation, critical thinking, analysis

## 🔧 **Implementation Strategy**

### **Step 1: Create Specialized Agents**
Each agent will have:
- Focused expertise in one question type
- Optimized prompts for that specific domain
- Consistent output format
- Quality standards tailored to the question type

### **Step 2: Orchestration Workflow**
- **Input**: Job description + generation requirements
- **Distribution**: Route to appropriate agents based on question type
- **Collection**: Gather outputs from all agents
- **Aggregation**: Combine and validate final question set
- **Output**: Deliver complete question bank

### **Step 3: Quality Control**
- Agent-specific validation rules
- Cross-agent consistency checks
- Overall quality assessment
- Metadata generation and validation

## 🔧 **N8N Workflow Implementation**

### **Workflow Structure:**
```
Input Node (Job Description + Requirements)
    ↓
Distribution Node (Route to Agents)
    ↓
┌─────────────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────────┐
│   Agent 1       │   Agent 2       │   Agent 3       │   Agent 4       │
│ Technical MCQ   │ Technical Text  │ Aptitude MCQ    │ Aptitude Text   │
│ Questions       │ Questions       │ Questions       │ Questions       │
└─────────────────┴─────────────────┴─────────────────┴─────────────────┘
    ↓
Collection Node (Gather All Outputs)
    ↓
Validation Node (Quality Control)
    ↓
Aggregation Node (Combine & Format)
    ↓
Output Node (Final Question Bank)
```

### **Distribution Logic:**
```javascript
// Calculate questions per agent based on requirements
const totalQuestions = 15;
const technicalPercentage = 70;
const aptitudePercentage = 30;
const mcqPercentage = 60;
const textPercentage = 40;

const technicalMCQ = Math.round(totalQuestions * technicalPercentage / 100 * mcqPercentage / 100);
const technicalText = Math.round(totalQuestions * technicalPercentage / 100 * textPercentage / 100);
const aptitudeMCQ = Math.round(totalQuestions * aptitudePercentage / 100 * mcqPercentage / 100);
const aptitudeText = Math.round(totalQuestions * aptitudePercentage / 100 * textPercentage / 100);
```

## 📊 **Expected Results**

### **Quality Improvements:**
- **Technical Questions**: More accurate, job-relevant technical content
- **Aptitude Questions**: Better logical reasoning and problem-solving
- **MCQ Questions**: Clearer options, better distractors
- **Text Questions**: More comprehensive explanations

### **Consistency Improvements:**
- **Formatting**: Consistent JSON structure across all agents
- **Quality**: Uniform quality standards within each type
- **Relevance**: Better job-specific relevance per question type
- **Validation**: Agent-specific validation rules

### **Operational Benefits:**
- **Maintenance**: Easier to update and improve individual agents
- **Debugging**: Isolated issues per agent type
- **Testing**: Independent testing of each agent
- **Scaling**: Easy to add new question types or agents

## 🚀 **Implementation Roadmap**

### **Phase 1: Create Specialized Agents**
1. Create 4 specialized AI agents in N8N
2. Develop focused prompts for each agent
3. Configure structured output parsers
4. Test individual agent performance

### **Phase 2: Build Orchestration Workflow**
1. Create distribution logic
2. Implement collection and aggregation
3. Add validation and quality control
4. Test end-to-end workflow

### **Phase 3: Optimize and Scale**
1. Fine-tune each agent based on results
2. Optimize distribution algorithms
3. Add advanced quality control
4. Scale to handle larger question sets

This multi-agent architecture will provide much better question quality and consistency compared to a single agent trying to handle all question types! 🎉
