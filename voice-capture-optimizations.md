# Voice Capture Optimizations

## Problem
- Voice capture was taking too long and starting in the middle of speech
- Users had to wait too long for processing
- Speech recognition was not responsive enough

## Optimizations Made

### 1. Reduced Processing Delays
- **onspeechend delay**: Reduced from 3000ms to 500ms
- **Minimum text length**: Reduced from 2 characters to 1 character
- **Speech end processing**: Now processes immediately after 500ms pause

### 2. Reduced Timeouts
- **Amazon Transcribe timeout**: Reduced from 8000ms to 3000ms
- **Web Speech API timeout**: Reduced from 30000ms to 10000ms
- **Overall timeout messages**: Updated to reflect 10-second timeouts

### 3. Immediate Partial Processing
- **Partial results**: Now processes immediately when text length > 5 characters
- **Early processing**: Auto-processes after 2 seconds of continuous speech
- **Lower thresholds**: Processes with as little as 1 character for final results

### 4. Enhanced Speech Recognition Settings
- **Continuous speech**: Enabled for better capture
- **Interim results**: Enabled for real-time feedback
- **Grammar constraints**: Removed for faster processing
- **Service URI**: Optimized for default service

### 5. Smart Processing Logic
- **Auto-processing timer**: Starts processing after 2 seconds of speech
- **Multiple trigger points**: Processes on partial results, speech end, or timer
- **Confidence levels**: Different confidence levels for different trigger points
  - Final results: 0.8 confidence
  - Partial results: 0.6 confidence
  - Early processing: 0.5 confidence

## Expected Results

### Before Optimization
- 3-8 second delay before processing
- Missed beginning of speech
- Long timeouts (30+ seconds)
- Waited for complete speech before processing

### After Optimization
- 500ms-2 second delay before processing
- Captures from beginning of speech
- Short timeouts (3-10 seconds)
- Processes partial results immediately

## Usage Instructions

1. **Start speaking immediately** - The system now captures from the beginning
2. **Speak naturally** - No need to pause or wait
3. **Short phrases work** - System processes even single words
4. **Faster responses** - AI responds much quicker

## Technical Details

- **Minimum processing threshold**: 1 character (down from 2)
- **Partial processing threshold**: 5 characters
- **Auto-processing timer**: 2 seconds after speech start
- **Speech end delay**: 500ms (down from 3000ms)
- **Amazon Transcribe timeout**: 3 seconds (down from 8)
- **Web Speech API timeout**: 10 seconds (down from 30)

The voice capture system is now optimized for immediate response and will capture speech from the very beginning instead of missing the start of user input.
